# BleachHack-unofficial
Unofficial port of BleachHack for 1.20.4.

You need the latest Java version in order for this to work. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Also change the Java executable in the Minecraft launcher to use the latest version. Refer to [this guide](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/changing-java-version/).

## NOTE!
Some stuff are broken. Don't expect everything to work. 

ALSO, don't come asking for support.
